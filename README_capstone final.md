# Find Impact of Tax Regulartion for a Company

**Sathya Venuraju**

## Executive summary
This experiment aims to predict how a proposed tax law change might impact a specific company. When a new tax law is suggested, it is often announced in a news article. The goal is to utilize natural language processing techniques to analyze these news articles and identify potential implications of the proposed law for the company in question.

## Rationale
This technology will empower company tax departments and tax and accounting firms to proactively assess the potential impact of tax law changes, providing them with valuable insights well ahead of implementation. By anticipating these changes, organizations can optimize their tax strategies, mitigate risks, and ensure timely compliance with evolving tax regulations.

## Research Question
How successfully we can predict the impact of a tax law change proposed by US states in the corporate tax domain. 

## Data Sources
**US State Tax Change News** : Sourced from a third-party tax research product under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This ensures access to reliable and up-to-date information on proposed or enacted changes in state tax laws.

**Tax Form Instructions** : Downloaded as PDFs from official state tax websites. For example, the instructions for New Jersey's corporate business tax form (CBT-100) can be found here: https://nj.gov/treasury/taxation/pdf/current/cbt/cbt100ins.pdf. These instructions provide clear guidance on how to complete and file the tax form, who is required to file it, and explain the business logic and conditions that companies need to consider when determining their tax obligations.

**Electronic Tax Filing Schemas**: Acquired from state tax websites. These are XSD (XML Schema Definition) files that define the specific elements (data fields) required for electronic tax filing. Each element within the schema corresponds to a specific line item on the tax form. This data structure ensures accurate and standardized electronic filing for state taxes.

## Methodology
**Data Ingestion**: Load news articles related to tax law changes into a structured data format, such as a Pandas DataFrame. This involves extracting relevant information like State code, article title and full text.

**Tax Form Description Creation**: Generate concise and informative descriptions for each tax form within a specific state. These descriptions should capture the form's purpose, the types of taxpayers it applies to, and the key tax concepts or regulations it covers.

**Expert Annotation**: Select a representative sample of news articles and request tax analysts to manually annotate the tax forms that are likely to be impacted by the changes discussed in each article. This human-annotated dataset will serve as a ground truth for model evaluation.

**Text Vectorization**: Employ natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings or transformer-based models, to convert news articles and tax form descriptions into numerical representations (vectors). This process allows the model to understand the semantic meaning and context of the text.

**Similarity Analysis**: Utilize a technique like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to calculate the similarity between the vectorized news articles and tax form descriptions. By identifying the most similar forms, the model can predict which forms might be affected by a particular tax law change.

**Model Evaluation**: Compare the predicted tax forms generated by the model with the human-annotated ground truth. This is basically a multi-class classification problem. The model should classify the news article into one or more Tax forms. So evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will assess the model's ability to accurately identify impacted forms and its overall effectiveness in predicting the consequences of tax law changes.

## Results
To assess the model's performance on this multi-class classification problem, I employed precision, recall, and the F2 score as evaluation metrics. The results are as follows:
Precision: 0.2836
Recall: 0.4849
F2 Score: 0.4246
The result means about 28% of the times the model was able to predict the correct
## Next steps
**Enhance NLP Techniques** : Leverage advanced natural language processing techniques, particularly transformer-based models like BERT, to significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the model's predictions.

**Fine-Tune Transformer Models**: Train the transformer models on a specialized corpus of tax form descriptions and other relevant tax domain text. This fine-tuning process will enable the model to better understand the nuances of tax language and regulations, leading to more accurate predictions.

**Leverage Line Item Descriptions and E-File Schema**: Incorporate detailed descriptions of line items from tax forms and e-file schema definitions into the model's analysis. By analyzing these elements, the model can identify specific line items that may be directly impacted by a tax law change, providing a more granular level of prediction.
